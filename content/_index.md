### About me

I have a strong interest in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, with a particular focus on optimization, efficiency, and low-level system programming. I enjoy reading kernel documentation and learning about low-level optimizations and the clever tricks that have been used to make the most of limited hardware. I am currently working on creating my own Linux distribution and writing documentation on various topics related to the Linux internals and other low-level systems programming topics, such as network programming(XDP) and the use of languages like C and x86 assembly. Overall, I have a passion for exploring and learning about the inner workings of low-level systems and finding ways to optimize and improve their performance.

#### JomOS

JomOS is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to mix-and-match well tested configurations and optimizations with little to no effort. JomOS integrates these configurations into one largely cohesive system.
