### About me

Hi, I'm a computer science student in my first year of university. I work with Linux and Unix-like systems. I enjoy optimizing systems to get the most out of hardware. I'm working on my own Linux distribution and also contribute to CachyOS, which is a similar distribution to mine. I also write Linux internals documentation. I've recently started learning eBPF and XDP.

### Highlights

#### CachyOS

Arch Linux based distribution with heavy optimizations and multi architecture support for ultimate desktop experience.

#### JomOS

JomOS is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to mix-and-match well tested configurations and optimizations with little to no effort. JomOS integrates these configurations into one largely cohesive system.
