Run [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.

Compilations, downloads, and other similar tasks should not be done on your primary computer. To avoid straining your current device, you can perform all of these tasks on a remote machine. Extensions can also be run remotely, consuming fewer system resources.

The default bundled electron isn't very optimized; however, with VS Code server, you can use your local web browser without having to launch another browser (electron). You can also maximize resource efficiency by using an optimized browser, such as [[notes/Thorium]].

I'm running code server on my Raspberry Pi, and I can also access the pi from anywhere using [[notes/ZeroTier]].
