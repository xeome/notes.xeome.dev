![[SV32_paging.png]]

The SV32 page table format uses a two-level page table structure with 32-bit virtual addresses and 4KB page sizes. The top-level page table has 1024 entries, each of which points to a second-level page table with 1024 entries. Each second-level page table entry points to a physical page frame or to another second-level page table.
