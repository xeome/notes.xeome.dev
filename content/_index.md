## About me

I am a computer engineering student with a strong interest in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, with a particular focus on optimization, efficiency, and low-level system programming. I enjoy reading kernel documentation and learning about low-level optimizations and the clever tricks that have been used to make the most of limited hardware. I am currently working on creating my own Linux distribution and writing documentation on various topics related to the Linux internals and other low-level systems programming topics, such as network programming(XDP) and the use of languages like C and x86 assembly. Overall, I have a passion for exploring and learning about the inner workings of low-level systems and finding ways to optimize and improve their performance.

## Highlights

### RiscV-kernel

A RISC-V kernel written in C and assembly. This project aims to implement a bare-metal kernel for the RISC-V ISA from scratch.

### JCC (jomo's C compiler)

An experimental C compiler written in C for the x86-64 ISA. Currently implements parsing, AST generation, and code generation for a subset of C99.

### CachyOS

Arch Linux based distribution with heavy optimizations and a focus on performance and efficiency. Features include a custom kernel, recompiled packages with custom flags, and tools for monitoring and optimizing system performance.

### Zmem

A Linux memory monitoring program that displays detailed information about virtual memory. It is designed to be fast and efficient, and it can be used to monitor memory usage in real-time.
