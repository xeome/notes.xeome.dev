## About me

I am a computer engineering student with a strong interest in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, with a particular focus on optimization, efficiency, and low-level system programming. I enjoy reading kernel documentation and learning about low-level optimizations and the clever tricks that have been used to make the most of limited hardware. I am currently working as a linux kernel engineer and I like writing documentation on various topics related to the Linux internals and other low-level systems programming topics, such as Linux kernel networking internals and user space networking interfaces. Overall, I have a passion for exploring and learning about the inner workings of low-level systems and finding ways to optimize and improve their performance.

## Highlights

- [riscv-kernel](https://github.com/xeome/riscv-kernel): A RISC-V kernel written in C and assembly. This project aims to implement a bare-metal kernel for the RISC-V ISA from scratch.
- [buse-nfs](https://github.com/xeome/buse-nfs): A project demonstrating the use of NBD to create a custom block device that synchronizes data with a remote buffer over the network.
- [XSKNet](https://github.com/xeome/XSKNet): A high performance custom networking stack for Linux using XDP and XSK. Bypasses the kernel network stack and receives/transmits packets directly from/to the network card.
- [JCC](https://github.com/xeome/jcc): This is a self hosting C compiler I have been writing from scratch.
- [Zmem](https://github.com/xeome/zmem): A Linux memory monitoring program that displays detailed information about virtual memory.
- [xm32](https://github.com/xeome/xm32-vm): xm32 is a custom 32-bit fantasy CPU architecture and virtual machine written in rust.
